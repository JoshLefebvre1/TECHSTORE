# TECHSTORE

The TECHSTORE was a website that I built using the .NET framework. It is meant to be an immitation of an online technology store such as Best Buy, where a user can browse through items and add them to their cart to be purchased and shipped. I used a series of gridviews and repeaters to display products from the database in an orderly and aesthetically pleasing manor. Users who are logged in also have the option of leaving comments and ratings for a particular item. The website also has an admin side where an admin can add, edit and delete item categories and products (and their descriptions).
